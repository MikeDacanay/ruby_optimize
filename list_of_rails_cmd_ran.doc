#1 Retrieve all players, then write a program that will loop through each player and display their team name, mascot and stadium. How many queries have we done?

players = Player.all
players.each do |player|
	team=player.team
	puts "#{team.name} #{team.stadium} #{team.mascot}"
end

#2 Retrieve all players and write a program to loop through each player and their team name, mascot and stadium using .includes. How many queries have we done now?

players = Player.includes(:team).all
players.each do |player|
	team=player.team
	puts "#{team.name} #{team.stadium} #{team.mascot}"
end

#3 Retrieve all players from the 'Chicago Bulls' by using .includes

Player.includes(:team).where("teams.name = 'Chicago Bulls'").references(:team)

#4 Retrieve all players along with the team name that play at the 'Staples Center'

Player.joins(:team).select("players.name as Player,  teams.name as Team").where("teams.stadium = 'Staples Center'")

5# Retrieve all teams that have any player that start their name with the letter 'Z' by using .includes and .joins

Team.includes(:players).where("players.name LIKE ?", "Z%")

Team.joins(:players).where("players.name LIKE 'Z%'").select("teams.name as team_name", "teams.*", "players.*")
